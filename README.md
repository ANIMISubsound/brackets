# brackets-git

Git extension for [Brackets](http://brackets.io/).

Developed on Windows with [msysgit](https://code.google.com/p/msysgit/) installed.

Also working on Mac with [Git for OS X](https://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer/) installed.

Currently not working on Linux due to Brackets issues, this will hopefully change in the future.

## Installation

You can use Brackets built-in [extension registry](https://brackets-registry.aboutweb.com/).

Extension can be configured in "File > Git Settings..." (this window will show the first time after you install the extension).

## Features

Try out and see, too many to keep this up-to-date. You can see the ```CHANGELOG.md``` for more info on this.
If you won't find the feature you were looking for, feel free to __open issues with your ideas__.

## Pull requests

This extension is developed in Brackets and pull requests always need to avoid any JSLint errors, feel free to modify ```/*jslint``` settings in the particular file if needed.
There is another [extension](https://github.com/MiguelCastillo/Brackets-Interactive-Linter) used for following JSHint rules specified in ```.jshintrc```.
Please check for errors before opening any pull requests.

Another very handy extension to use is [brackets-todo](https://github.com/mikaeljorhult/brackets-todo) which helps you add bookmarks for things to be resolved later.
